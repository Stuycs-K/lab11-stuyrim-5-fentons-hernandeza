# APCS - Stuyrim

## Key
:white_check_mark: This feature works.

:question: This feature works partially.

:ballot_box_with_check: This extra (beyond the things that the lab was supposed to do) feature works.

:x: This required feature does not work.

:beetle: This is a bug that affects the game.


## Features

:white_check_mark: Sleep status condition, managed by editing sleep count and checking if the adventurer can move in Game.java.

:white_check_mark: Bleed persistant damage, made by triggerBleed in adventurer/bleedCount and utilized via techpriest attacks function.

:white_check_mark: Attack tick and attack multiplier, the reason for both existing was to make attack tick being negative an easier thing to manage.

:white_check_mark: Distributable damage from a single turn through the cyborg special attack.

:white_check_mark: Clearing of all status conditions in the lich support.

:white_check_mark: Power word kill being unique to TechnoLich and dealing true damage, which is essentially just removing attack multiplier.

:white_check_mark: Cool border, made by an edited draw border function.

:white_check_mark: Random name generator made via dictionary of names.

| Support  | Example Controls |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Support with just a number now supports the enemy (some supports are debuffs though only for the boss which makes this very slightly redundant, but maybe you want to heal the enemy), a support command with the word party in it now supports your allies and a support command with no number now supports the charachter who called it| | support Enemy (s 0), support ally (s party 0), support self (s) ✅  |
